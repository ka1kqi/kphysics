outline of proj

kphysics_ monte carlo simulation of particle diffusion, based on mcphysics

todo_
    add utils.c to retrieve https data
    create list objects
    get isotope data using curl
    makefile
    beta paricle track class/struct


structure_
    list of interaction points in material inside each voxel? 
    maybe do just list of interactions then
    alpha particles don't have travel far enough to leave voxel
    list of voxels
    voxel object, store each voxel and maintain list of interactions in each voxel.
